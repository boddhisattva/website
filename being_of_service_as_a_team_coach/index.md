**Why do I care about team related coaching?**

Looking back at my 12+ years career as a software developer, for a long time I was under the impression that software development is a lot about technology and communication. Having a chance to reflect more deeply on my personal experiences as a software developer and a fellow team member:

  - I started to realise that **software development and working in teams** in general is a also a lot about **people, relationships, empathy, understanding and having a genuine sense of connection among fellow team members**
    - Without these 5 elements there would be no communication or technology
  - Having worked with people from Europe(Germany, Poland, UK etc.,), America(US, Latin America), Africa(Kenya, South Africa etc.,) and Asia(Singapore, India etc.,), I learnt **nothing connects us more in diverse teams than agreed upon shared human and engineering values** and the role they play in
    - **establishing common ground**
    - **driving behavior**
    - how we **eventually feel about one another**
      - Having learnt some of these values the hard way and the impact it had on me and my family, this is something very dear to my heart and **I care about** making it easier for other **fellow humans** just so that they **have more joyful and fulfilling working relationships** and also **get to live happier lives in the grand scheme of things**

**P.S**: It just so happens **when you build such a genuine relationship and connection centric  team and organization culture**, that a **natural by product** of this is more **joyful and productive team members and organisations**
