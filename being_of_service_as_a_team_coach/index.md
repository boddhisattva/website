**Why do I care about team related coaching?**

In my 12+ years as a software developer, I initially believed software development was mainly about technology and communication. However, upon reflecting on my experiences further, I realized that **software development in teams is actually a lot about people, relationships, empathy, and having a sense of genuine connection with team members, towards a company mission/product and for one's end customers**.

Without these elements, neither communication nor technology can thrive. Working with diverse team members based in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia, Iâ€™ve learned that **nothing connects us more than shared human and engineering values and that they are key to**:

- **Establishing common ground**
- **Guiding behavior**
- **Shaping how we eventually feel about one another**

I **learned some of these lessons the hard way**, and having witnessed the impact it had on me professionally and personally on my family, this is **very dear to my heart**. That's also why fostering positive, meaningful relationships in teams is so important to me. I want others to have more fulfilling work relationships, which lead to happier, more joyful lives for every individual & for each of their families.

P.S. It just so happens **when one builds such a genuine relationship and connection centric  team and organization culture**, that a **natural by product** of this is more **joyful and productive team members and organisations**
