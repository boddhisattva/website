Imagine **a workplace where every team member feels understood & connected** with one’s colleagues, **such a joyful work environment intrinsically drives high performance & success**.

This is the kind of culture I aim to foster as a team coach. By **using my current experience of serving as both an engineer and a [coach](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/mohnish-gemini-jadwani)**, I **bring a deeper understanding of what it’s like to be in the shoes of a fellow engineer**. This **increased empathy allows me to better serve** towards a goal where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.


I believe **[this true story of a recent attempt](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7244011733604786176/)** to **genuinely connect people** who are originally from Asia, Europe & Africa(and that are now based in Europe & Australia) through playing a connection based game **could serve as a good example of how I intend to be of service.**


More specifically, I intend to serve with regard to the below:

- **Building Resilient and Self-Organizing Teams** –
Equip teams to navigate pressure, challenges, and maintain long-term productivity by working with team members to harness their unique strengths and by encouraging autonomy and adaptability through different means.
- **Cultivating a Feeling of Genuine Connection Among Team Members** –
Foster strong interpersonal relationships, enhancing collaboration and trust through meaningful conversations and periodical activities that genuinely increase bonding, leading to higher team performance and morale.
- **Conflict Mediation** –
Guide teams through conflicts through customized ways that better work for the individuals involved, helping them resolve differences while maintaining harmony and boosting collaboration.
- **Focusing on Shared (Human, Engineering) Values to Drive Behavior** – Align team actions by working with its members to define their team specific values that eventually result increased engagement and a better sense of accountability towards a common goal/objective.
- **Building a Culture of Belonging, Inclusion & Equity** – Asking people what they value leads to increased awareness of what is important to them. Factoring those inputs into a work environment make every team member feel seen and valued, that way people feel more intrinsically motivated to do their best work each day
- **Building Psychological Safety** – Being vulnerable and asking right questions creates a safe space for other people to be vulnerable and more openly speak about their strengths & areas of improvement. As a result, build on each others strengths and looking out for one another in their areas of improvements, leads to a better sense of working as a team and it leads to increased performance both as a team and a company.
- **Establishing Purpose & Mission (for Projects, Teams)** – Clarity drives focus and involvement leads to committment. Provide clear direction and having people define and agree on a project mission drives focus and alignment which in turn leads to achieving more impactful results.
- **Improving Feedback Culture (Giving & Receiving Feedback) Within Teams** – We all have blindspots and that's more of a reason why feedback is a gift.
By surfacing this for their consideration, I intend to encourage them to be more receptive to building their feedback giving & sharing skills such that i leads to a culture of continuous improvement and also results in increased team & individual performance.
- **Building Emotional Intelligence** – Encourage team members to consider varying perspecives before they respond to a situation so that with a broader view of things and increased empathy they are able to make better decisions and more effectively navigate interpersonal dynamics

**Why Team Coaching Matters to Me**

In my 12+ years as a software developer, I initially thought success in Software development was about technology and communication. However, I’ve come to realize that **building great software** is really about **people and about fostering empathy, relationships, and genuine connection with team members, towards a company mission/product and for one’s end customers**.

Without these core human elements, neither technology nor communication can thrive. Working with diverse teams across the globe has taught me **that shared human and engineering values are the glue that unites us, guides our behavior, and also shapes how we eventually feel about one another**

These lessons became more dearer to me when I learnt some of them the hard way and after seeing the impact it had on me professionally and on my family personally. I want others to have more fulfilling work relationships, which lead to happier, more joyful lives for every individual & for each of their families.

**Let’s Build Strong Teams Together**

If you’re looking for someone to help **elevate your team** by **aligning your team members towards a shared purpose** and mission, **fostering connection**, **building resilience**, and **cultivating a values-driven culture**, I’d love to connect and see how I can be of service.
