Having **worked in person with International teams** based in **Singapore**, **The UK** and currently in **Germany** and having the wonderful opportunity to **remotely work with diverse team members from other countries in America, Europe, Africa and Asia**, I've come to get a better understanding(some the hard way) of what unites us better as fellow humans and more so as part of a team towards a common goal.

Also, **I believe being an engineer in addition to being a team coach helps me more closely see what's it like to be in the shoes of a fellow engineer on a more regular basis**. The increased sense of empathy from the above towards fellow team members and the related past experiences of working with people from different cultures motivate me to be a team coach and more specifically serve with regard to the below:

- **Building Resilient and Self-Organizing Teams** – Empower teams to be better at navigating pressure and challenges, ensuring sustained productivity over the long term.
- **Cultivating a Feeling of Genuine Connection Among Team Members** – This leads to better collaboration and eventually builds a deeper sense of trust, enhancing team cohesion and overall performance.
- **Conflict Mediation** – Resolve differences effectively to maintain harmony, reduce downtime, build understanding and improve team collaboration.
- **Focusing on Shared (Human, Engineering) Values to Drive Behavior** – Align team actions with core values to improve engagement and work with a sense of accountability towards a common goal/objective.
- **Building a Culture of Belonging, Inclusion & Equity** – Create an environment where every team member feels seen and valued, so that people feel more intrinsically motivated to do their best work each day
- **Building Psychological Safety** – Create a safe space for people to be vulnerable and more openly speak about their strengths & areas of improvement. As a result, build on each others strengths and look out for one another in their areas of improvements, leading to stronger problem-solving capabilities as a unit and also promoting individual growth opportunties.
- **Establishing Purpose & Mission (for Projects, Teams)** – Provide clear direction and motivation, driving focus and alignment towards achieving impactful results.
- **Improving Feedback Culture (Giving & Receiving Feedback) Within Teams** – Cultivate a culture of continuous improvement, fostering growth and better individual & team performance.
- **Building Emotional Intelligence** – Strengthen interpersonal dynamics, boosting team collaboration, empathy, and decision-making effectiveness.

**More reasons as to why do I care about team related coaching?**

In my 12+ years as a software developer, I initially believed software development was mainly about technology and communication. However, upon reflecting on my experiences further, I realized that **software development in teams is actually a lot about people, relationships, empathy, and having a sense of genuine connection with team members, towards a company mission/product and for one's end customers**.

Without these elements, neither communication nor technology can thrive. Working with diverse team members based in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia, I’ve learned that **nothing connects us more than shared human and engineering values and that they are key to**:

- **Establishing common ground**
- **Guiding behavior**
- **Shaping how we eventually feel about one another**

I **learned some of these lessons the hard way**, and having witnessed the impact it had on me professionally and personally on my family, this is **very dear to my heart**. That's also why fostering positive, meaningful relationships in teams is so important to me. I want others to have more fulfilling work relationships, which lead to happier, more joyful lives for every individual & for each of their families.

P.S. It just so happens **when one builds such a genuine relationship and connection centric  team and organization culture**, that a **natural by product** of this is more **joyful and productive team members and organisations**
