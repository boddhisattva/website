From building MVPs to optimizing large-scale Ruby on Rails applications, I bring a blend of technical expertise, product focus, leadership skills & coaching/mentoring experience.

As a software engineer, my core strengths include:

- Crafting scalable solutions with tools & technologies like [Packs-Rails](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs-rails), Sorbet, Rails engines, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Redis, and more.

- Enhancing performance and observability using tools like Datadog, Redash, and New Relic, ensuring your apps run smoothly and efficiently.

- Debugging, refactoring, and enhancing existing software systems(including legacy ones), helping businesses evolve and adapt over time.

- Leading projects, fostering collaboration and delivering results that count.

- **Examples of Open source work** and more recent code samples can be found **[here](https://gist.github.com/boddhisattva/7e394480e8b56870bd43e6c188e9ff1c)**

Beyond technical implementation, I value:

- **Having a product-minded approach**, meaning I think beyond code and value
  - Ideating in discussions related to user journeys and personas that eventually lead to more user-friendly products
  - Taking inputs directly from different teams and stakeholders as & when needed in an attempt to build better features or when fixing important bugs that impact one's customers

- **Proactive communication**: Communicating early and often is key to the success of any project, and I’ve been told by many people communication is my strength. Whether it's breaking down and explaining complex concepts or aligning cross-functional teams, I’m committed to keeping everyone on the same page.

- **Sharing my two cents as a coach, mentor or fellow developer**: Mentors
have played a key role in helping me improve and I attempt to pay it forward in a probono way [here](https://bit.ly/probono_coaching_mentoring_connect_with_mohnish). In addition to leveraging past experiences as coach/mentor, I intend to:
  -  As a coach: Ask questions that enable people to think for themselves and thereby be more independent
  - As a mentor/fellow developer: Share different perspectives for the consideration of fellow colleagues to explore together best ways of getting things done

* **Building and being part of a closely knit team**: There is a saying failure can teach you a lot more than success. Having worked in person with international teams based in Singapore, The UK, and currently Germany for 7+ years, and having worked remotely with people from America, Europe, Africa and Asia, I’ve learned a number of lessons(some the hard way) of what truly builds strong, cohesive teams — and I’d love to bring those insights and leverage those experiences as and when needed.

If you’re looking for someone who can not only code but also coach, mentor, and help elevate your team, let’s connect.
