From building MVPs to optimizing large-scale Ruby on Rails applications, **I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, product focus**, and **leadership skills**. My approach goes beyond just coding: I'm here to ensure your projects succeed both technically and strategically.

**As a software engineer, my core strengths include**:

- **Crafting Scalable Solutions**: Experience with using tools & technologies like [Packs-Rails](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs-rails), Sorbet, Rails engines, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Redis, and more to build scalable & maintainable applications.

- **Performance and observability**: Enhancing app performance with built in and other tools like **Datadog**, **Redash**, and **New Relic** for smooth and efficient operation.

- **Enhancing, Debugging, refactoring apps**: Improving, refactoring existing systems and also upgrading legacy systems to keep your business evolving and adapting to software changes over time.

- **Project Leadership**: Leading projects with a focus on collaboration, delivering meaningful results that count.

**Beyond technical implementation, I intend to add value with**:

- **Having a product-minded approach**, meaning I value
  - **Ideating to improve one's product offerings**: By participating in discussions related to **user journeys** and **personas** I care about contributing to product roadmap decisions that eventually lead to more user-friendly products

  - **Cross Team collaboration**: As needed, I value seeking inputs directly from stakeholders and others teams to build better features, fix bugs, and deliver timely solutions that genuinely serve your customers.

- **Proactive communication**:
  - Communicating early and often is key to the success of any project, and I’ve been told by many people **communication is my strength**. Whether it's breaking down and explaining complex concepts or aligning cross-functional teams, **I’m committed to keeping everyone on the same page**.

- **Being a multiplier in teams**: Mentors
have played a key role in helping me improve and I attempt to pay it forward in a probono way [here](https://bit.ly/probono_coaching_mentoring_connect_with_mohnish). In addition to leveraging past experiences at and outside work as coach/mentor, I intend to:
  - **As a coach**: **Ask the right questions** to encourage independent thinking and thereby **to enable people to be more self sufficient**
  - **As a mentor**: Offer different perspectives and be a sounding board, helping colleagues solve problems and validate ideas.

* **Building a closely knit team**: I’ve had wonderful opportunities of working in person with international teams from Singapore, The UK, and Germany for over 7 years, and remotely with team members across North & South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Through these experiences, I’ve learned what makes teams strong and cohesive—and I’m eager to apply these lessons to help your team succeed.
