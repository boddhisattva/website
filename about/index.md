##### Joyful Greetings for the day :), I'm Mohnish

A human being **driven by values** & a person who **cares about people & his work**. By profession, I'm a **freelance software programmer living in Berlin**, Germany with **10+ years** of software development experience, including **1.5 years** in a **lead developer** role. Technologies and frameworks that I have experience and would like to work with include - **Ruby, Rails, Python and Elixir**. You can learn more about my **[past freelance work from here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohnish-jadwani-9a924619/)**

Reflecting on writing software for the last 10+ years has taught me **Software development** is a lot about **people, empathy and communication**. Having worked with people in Europe(Germany, UK etc.,), America(US, Latin America), Africa and Asia(Singapore, India etc.,), I've learnt that nothing connects us more than agreed upon **shared values** to drive behavior and how we eventually feel about one another. My experience has taught me this is a combination of [human](https://www.notion.so/sadhakforlife/Personal-User-Manual-Mohnish-628423c4dbd14e188a8ae7474e689f54#0c61c76018c4467baa23b3d6b7d660ea) and [engineering values](https://www.notion.so/sadhakforlife/Personal-User-Manual-Mohnish-628423c4dbd14e188a8ae7474e689f54#c62ad0739e444eb7b414075aa8805e70) and having learnt some of these values the hard way, this is something very dear to my heart and with people being one of my forte's alongside programming, I'm also **open to Tech Lead/Team Lead/Agile coaching roles** towards building **humane work cultures** and **resiliency** in teams because I believe, in today's challenging times surrounding a pandemic like Corona and things like inflation and layoffs, these are key ingredients to building a better team towards building a great product.

In case you'd like to connect for a project you have in mind, feel free to connect via: **mail4mohnishj@gmail.com**.

**I believe in being of service**/giving back/paying it forward and whenever feasible I also do **probono mentorship** through [Mentoring Club](https://www.mentoring-club.com/). You can book a session with me through [here](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/mohnish-gemini-jadwani) and I'll also do my best to respond to any question you may have for me in a mentoring context via the above email(time permitting)

Thank you for taking the time out to learn more about me and have a fulfilling day ahead! :)

P.S: In case you don't see any open booking sessions available on my mentoring club profile, it's most likely due to my limited availability of doing such sessions whenever feasible.
