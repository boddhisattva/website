In one of my past roles, we as a ‘new’ team were working on a project that was not only critical to the business but also had stringent completion timelines.

This along with a few other factors put a lot of pressure on all of us as a team & it impacted our working relationships.

Personally while working together then, based on certain behaviors I observed in my team members, I wondered if I could fully trust them.

A mentor who I spoke to about this shared - “I trust by default & you’ll need to earn my distrust”. This for me was deep. I started applying ‘**Default to Trust**’ as **1 of my values at work**.

When working from Singapore(before moving to Germany), I first learnt about ‘**values**’ in general & how it **determines** **how we respond to situations** and also how it can genuinely serve as **common language to effectively communicate and better connect with people across different cultures etc**., I dug deeper & I learnt about **‘assume best intentions’** as **another value** back then.

**Using Default to trust** along with **assume best intentions** into my **daily conversations with the team**, although slowly, it **started improving my working relationships** with them.

**Values** as far as I’ve seen them as a developer in the software industry could be categorised into **3 types**

- Company values
- Engineering Department values
- Team specific values(or norms)

All of this was happening in a software engineering team context & hence I refer to the above 2 values specifically as **engineering values** because they **cater** specifically towards the **challenges & the related pressure we as members of a software team may face** from time to time **when delivering software under specific circumstances like a tight deadline, newly formed team etc.,**

After **experiencing the positive impact these engineering values had on me personally & my relationships within a team context**, my quest to explore them further grew deeper & I found out that I was not alone.

Many **#US** software **companies**(like **[Asana](https://theworkback.com/asana-engineering-values-2/)** etc.,) were already **implementing them** & in **#Europe** I’ve come across **companies** like **[Hubspot](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/hubspots-engineering-values)** & **[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-engineering-values-we-live-by/)** using them too. In the companies I’ve worked so far in #Germany, to my best knowledge, I hadn’t seen this implemented yet.

## Why care about having one's engineering values defined in today's times?

**Context:** The current **challenging economic conditions** in Europe amidst the **ongoing war, rising inflation, layoffs** in countries like US, Germany & in many other European countries are in their own way **creating a high pressure environment for the current employees to deliver** to their best abilities.

- This builds pressure on each of us to perform & in such situations especially, given that **every individuals capacity to handle pressure within a team can be different**, if **we just remember some of these engineering values** like ‘assume best intentions’ or basically giving other members a benefit of a doubt when you may observe behavior that you wouldn’t normally expect, **it could go a long way in keeping a work relationship intact** & it in turn **helps us as a software team look out for each other more naturally**.

- There is a saying, **involvement leads to committment**. **Having these values agreed upon, written & practiced among team members builds more empathy and a better sense of belonging** as well among each other, because **we see each other as a human being** who’s on their individual journey trying to navigate their way through their professional & personal challenges in these uncertain times **and at the same time we see them as an integral part of a unit**, which is one's own team. **Having this perspective and genuinely internalising it one's day to day in turn builds more trust with one another and this in turn builds psychological safety.**

- Having these **engineering values also keeps us accountable** and in check and it **leads to lesser situations of pressure getting the better of us** because we'd have our agreed upon department and team specific **engineering values** that can **serve as a reminder and guiding light** on how we could **balance relationships** and **strike the right kind of conversations** especially when the stakes are high, just like in the current challenging times.

- **I’ve personally learnt some of [these engineering values](https://www.notion.so/sadhakforlife/Personal-User-Manual-Mohnish-628423c4dbd14e188a8ae7474e689f54?pvs=4#c62ad0739e444eb7b414075aa8805e70) the hard way** in my life & **I wish someone had told me about some of them earlier** when I was facing some difficulties navigating some of my existing work related challenges back then especially in a high pressure work environment. The **engineering values have also proven to be my saviour since then** from time to time in their own way.

The **[Intercom’s blog on engineering values](https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-engineering-values-we-live-by/)** conveys this point home very well on the role **engineering values** play in shaping **great products** .

In the coming days, I intend to share more on some of these engineering values, how did I come to realise them and how using them helped me in the past navigate pressure and challenging circumstances/times better & how it continues to help me as a software dev even in these current times.

With that said, I welcome your valuable feedback on this post and if I may, I'd like to invite you to consider asking yourself/reflecting upon one question: **Would you now consider defining engineering values to better equip your colleagues with ways that could help them more efficiently tackle today's challenging and uncertain times?**
