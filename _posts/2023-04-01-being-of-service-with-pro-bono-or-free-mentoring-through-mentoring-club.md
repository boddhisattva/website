After a long hiatus, I'm aiming to be of service more regularly in case one would like to connect for a pro bono/free mentoring session on the below topics amidst these challenging times through here: https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/mohnish-gemini-jadwani.


**My why behind doing such sessions**:

1.  What's shared here: https://lnkd.in/eGs2wt3w

2. Additionally among other things, **Pema Chödrön's quote: ‘If we are willing to stand fully in our own shoes and never give up on ourselves, then we will be able to put ourselves in the shoes of others and never give up on them’ keeps me going.**



**Mentoring Topics**:

- Getting a Software Engineer job

- Getting a Software engineer job abroad(Have personal experiences of being employed in Germany, Singapore)

- Applying for Freelancer Visa in Germany as an Expat

- Life of an Expat Freelancer in Germany and learnings along the way

- Self Improvement(through self-awareness, reflection, observation, planning, journaling etc.,)

- Engineering Values: Why, What and How

- Creating a work culture that is centered around values, listening, feedback, psychological safety, diversity, equity, inclusion and sense of belonging

- Communication(verbal, body language, cues, tone, written etc.,)

- Building endurance and resilience in teams

- Building self-organising/autonomous teams

- Leadership(Leading teams, leading projects, being a better leader)

- Becoming a better programmer

- Becoming a better Ruby developer

- Team work(having a team mission, purpose, working agreement etc.,)

- Interview preparation - Resume writing/review, cover letter writing/review, general tips, Preparing for different rounds for a Backend Software Engineer role

- Hiring(Preparing different interview types, Preparing more meaningful and more inclusive Job Descriptions, Making interviews a more level playing field, hiring people from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds etc.,)

- Energy Management

- Time management

- Career Development

- Emotional Intelligence

- Conflict Mediation

- Contributing to Open Source(through code and documentation contributions) as a programmer

- Other ways of contributing to the Open Source Community(Blogging, Speaking at meetups/conferences, coaching, organising and facilitating meetups)

- Being a sounding board: Sometimes words are not enough to describe what it feels like to be truly listened to. Feel free to validate your ideas/thoughts.

- Yoga and meditation for one's personal well-being


**P.S**: I'm currently experimenting with seeing how regularly I can do the sessions going forward. In case you don't see any open sessions at a given point in time it could be because of either me tweaking to see how often can I connect or due to limited availability of doing such sessions whenever feasible.
